# Fengshu-ai

## Overview

**Fengshu-ai** is a project aimed at helping users redesign their living spaces using Feng Shui and interior design principles. By leveraging AI and computer vision technologies, Fengshu-ai provides practical suggestions for rearranging existing furniture and enhancing room layouts to promote positive energy flow and harmony.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Fengshu-ai**, you will need to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder.

1. Download the dataset from [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/mokhamed-nagy-u69zl/furniture-detection-qiufc).
2. Place the downloaded dataset in the `data` folder.

## Features

- **Room Analysis**: Upload a photo of your room for analysis.
- **Furniture Identification**: Use AI to extract and identify current room furniture.
- **Feng Shui Recommendations**: Receive alternatives to redesign your space using Feng Shui principles.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Get actionable suggestions for improvements with various pieces of furniture.

## Technologies Used

- **Computer Vision**: For object detection and furniture identification.
- **Vision and Language Models (VLMs)**: To process visual data and apply textual Feng Shui rules.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: For generating design suggestions based on identified furniture and Feng Shui principles.

## Roadmap

- **Furniture Detection**: Develop methods for extracting and identifying furniture from a single image.
- **Feng Shui Integration**: Apply Feng Shui rules to provide actionable interventions based on furniture identification.
- **User Interface Development**: Create an intuitive interface for users to upload photos and receive suggestions.
- **Visualization Enhancements**: Implement techniques to show visual representations of suggested redesigns.
- **Expert Insights**: Integrate expert interior design advice for more effective suggestions.
- **Technology Exploration**:
  - Evaluate tools like [Text-to-Room](https://lukashoel.github.io/text-to-room/) for room modeling.
  - Consider [Polycam](https://poly.cam/) for 3D scanning using LiDAR technology.
  - Explore Vision and Language Models as per [Hugging Face's VLMs](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms).
  - Research on [F-VLM](https://research.google/blog/f-vlm-open-vocabulary-object-detection-upon-frozen-vision-and-language-models/) for open-vocabulary object detection.

## Feng Shui Principles Applied

### Dos

1. **Maximize Light Exposure**: Position furniture to allow for maximum natural light.
2. **Incorporate Plants**: Use plants like aloe vera, bamboo, or ficus to promote positive energy flow.
3. **Element of Fire**: Include elements representing fire to promote passion and energy.

5. **Keep it Clean**: Maintain a clutter-free environment for better energy flow.
6. **Element of Earth**: Incorporate earth elements to promote stability and balance.
